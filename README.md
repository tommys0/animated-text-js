# Animated Typing Text

## Description

This project provides a JavaScript-based animated typing effect for text rendering, creating a dynamic and engaging display for various purposes.

## Usage

To integrate this animated typing text into your project:

1. Copy the JavaScript code provided (`script.js`) into your project directory.
2. Link the JavaScript file in your HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
    ```

3. Add an HTML element with the ID `extention` where the text animation will be displayed:

    ```html
    <p id="extention"></p>
    ```
      You can also add class to the tag so you can design it in CSS.

4. Customize the text to be displayed by modifying the `extensions` array in the JavaScript file:

    ```javascript
    const extensions = [
        "traveller",
        "designer",
        "photographer",
    ];
    ```

    Change the words within the array to suit your desired animated text.
